This repository contains a build system to transpile React components into a self-contained library for use in Framer X. This was built in order to bridge the gap between the components used in design and their counterparts in production. Components are styled via styled-components.

### Installation

1. Clone, download or fork this repository
2. `cd framerx-build-system && yarn install`

### Available Commands

#### `yarn build`

Bundles the production codebase into ES6 and copies it into the `/lib` inside Framer X contents.

#### `yarn sync:lib`

Replaces `/lib` inside Framer X contents with the latest version of the build.

#### `yarn sync:src`

replaces the contents of `/src` with the content of the Framer X file.

#### `yarn sync:framerx`

Builds a new Framer X file in case of conflicts or file corruption with the contents of `/lib` and `/src`.
